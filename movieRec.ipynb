      "    * **The medical aspects?**  (e.g., documentaries about treatments, research, etc.)\n",

      "    * **Specific types of cancer?** (e.g., leukemia, breast cancer, etc.)\n",
      "    * **A particular age group affected?** (e.g., children with cancer, adults facing a diagnosis, etc.)\n",
      "    * **A specific tone?** (e.g., uplifting stories of survival, gritty realistic portrayals, comedic approaches to coping, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Gather Relevant Information (if possible):** If I have access to a movie database, I can search for films containing keywords related to cancer,  checking descriptions for plot summaries and themes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Filter and Prioritize:** Based on the user's (inferred or explicit) preferences, I'll filter the results.  For example, if I infer the user is looking for an emotional drama, I'll prioritize films with strong reviews focusing on the emotional journey of characters dealing with cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Recommend a Selection of Movies:**  Instead of giving just one recommendation (which might not perfectly align with the user's preferences), I'll suggest 3-5 diverse movies that cover different aspects or tones related to cancer.  This allows the user to choose the movie that best suits their interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Provide Concise Descriptions:** For each recommended movie, I'll provide a short description highlighting its relevant aspects (e.g., \"A heartwarming story about a family's journey through a child's leukemia diagnosis,\" or \"A realistic portrayal of the challenges faced by a woman battling breast cancer\").\n",
